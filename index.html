    <h1>EcoLane: Rethinking the Road to Breathe Easier</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>EcoLane started with a simple idea: we realised that road traffic is responsible for a major proportion of CO₂ emissions in Europe. In the Paris region, it accounts for more than half. Although the use of electric vehicles is gaining ground, they are not enough to respond to the climate emergency. So we need to act now. That's why we came up with the idea of EcoLane.</p>
      <p>We started with the idea that roads could do more than just transport cars. At EcoLane, we believe that they can also make an active contribution to purifying the air. Our project transforms the Paris ring road into an ecological corridor. By combining nature and technology, we want to give the city of Paris a quality of life that matches its beauty.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Our project is based on three complementary points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plantations of miscanthus and dwarf paulownia, selected for their rapid growth, low maintenance and exceptional ability to capture CO₂.</li>
        <li>Absorbent foam blocks, integrated into lane separators and verges, which can retain up to 1,000 tonnes of CO₂ per year for 250 units installed.</li>
        <li>Bioreactors installed on the central medians, capable of transforming the CO₂ captured into green energy or recoverable biomass.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Project Progress</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A research and development phase (3 years): plant selection, material design and initial environmental simulations.</li>
        <li>Two years of tests in real conditions to validate safety, effectiveness and urban integration.</li>
        <li>One year of installation to cover 35 km of the Paris ring road, representing around 15 hectares of vegetation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Our ESG Commitments</h2>

      <h3>Environment</h3>
      <p>The project's main aim is to absorb CO₂ from the ring road. With miscanthus, foam blocks and bioreactors, we aim to reduce Paris’s CO₂ emissions by 12,000 tonnes per year—around 10% of total emissions. Bioreactors convert gases into green energy. EcoLane improves air quality and quality of life for residents.</p>

      <h3>Social</h3>
      <p>We create jobs locally, work with small farmers and nurseries, and entrust maintenance and recycling to local agencies. This strengthens the project's social and economic impact.</p>

      <h3>Governance</h3>
      <p>We believe in full transparency. All our data and results are shared publicly, with no hidden figures. We value facts and open communication.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Internal Values and Practices</h2>
      <h3>Internal Structure and Team</h3>
      <p>EcoLane will employ 40 to 50 people on-site in Paris: engineers, biotech experts, landscape architects, data analysts and coordinators. We also work closely with nurseries, farms and urban maintenance agencies.</p>

      <h3>Workplace and Organisation</h3>
      <p>We will operate in eco-responsible buildings close to our infrastructure. We prioritise employee well-being and foster a flexible, collaborative environment. We aim to retain talent long-term and promote a merit-based remuneration system.</p>

      <h2>Project Development</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>R&D phase: €2–3 million</li>
        <li>Deployment: ~€5 million</li>
        <li>Annual maintenance: < €500,000</li>
        <li>Return on investment: 6–8 years via carbon credits, public subsidies and replication</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Expansion</h2>
      <p>Depending on the results achieved in Paris, we aim to deploy EcoLane in any city with suitable climate for miscanthus and dwarf paulownia.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>PESTLE Analysis – Impact and Development</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Policy:</strong> Supported by local authorities thanks to ecological and social impact.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic:</strong> Local job creation, support for local businesses, viable ROI.</li>
        <li><strong>Social:</strong> Job creation and pollution reduction, local partnerships.</li>
        <li><strong>Technological:</strong> Bioreactors and absorbent foam blocks represent scalable innovations.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental:</strong> Significant CO₂ reduction and air quality improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal:</strong> Full compliance with all environmental and urban regulations.</li>
      </ul>
