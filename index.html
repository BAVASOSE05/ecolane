    <!-- Our Vision -->
    <section>
      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>EcoLane started with a simple idea: we realised that road traffic is responsible for a major proportion of CO₂ emissions in Europe. In the Paris region, it accounts for more than half. Although the use of electric vehicles is gaining ground, they are not enough to respond to the climate emergency. So we need to act now. That's why we came up with the idea of EcoLane.</p>
      <p>We started with the idea that roads could do more than just transport cars.</p>
      <p>At EcoLane, we believe that they can also make an active contribution to purifying the air. Our project transforms the Paris ring road into an ecological corridor. By combining nature and technology, we want to give the city of Paris a quality of life that matches its beauty.</p>

    <!-- Our Mission -->
    <section>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Our project is based on three complementary points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plantations of miscanthus and dwarf paulownia, they have been selected for their rapid growth, low maintenance and exceptional ability to capture CO₂.</li>
        <li>Absorbent foam blocks, integrated into lane separators and verges, which can retain up to 1 000 tonnes of CO₂ per year for 250 units installed.</li>
        <li>Bioreactors installed on the central medians, capable of transforming the CO₂ captured into green energy or recoverable biomass.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Project Progress -->
    <section>
      <h2>Project Progress</h2>
      <p>We have structured the project into three main stages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A research and development phase (3 years), aimed at the plant selection, material design and initial environmental simulations.</li>
        <li>Two years of tests in real conditions to validate the safety, effectiveness and urban integration of the system.</li>
        <li>One year of installation to cover 35 km of the Paris ring road, i.e. around 15 ha of vegetated surfaces.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Our ESG Commitments -->
    <section>
      <h2>Our ESG Commitments</h2>

      <h3>Environment</h3>
      <p>The main aim of the project is to absorb CO₂ on the ring road, as statistics show that urban transport is one of the main sources of global warming. By installing miscanthus and bioreactors on the median strip of the ring road, as well as blocks of foam on the hard shoulder and dwarf paulownia on the verges of the ring road, we intend to drastically reduce Paris's CO₂ emissions. We can absorb 12 000 tonnes of CO₂ per year, which represents around 10 % of the total emissions from the ring road. Our bioreactors enable us to convert some of the gases absorbed into green energy. EcoLane promises better air quality for residents, as well as improved living conditions as a result.</p>

      </div>

      <h3>Social</h3>
      <p>We want to create jobs in the regions where we operate, as well as supporting small farmers and gardeners by growing our trees in local nurseries and farms. The recycling of the moss paving stones, and the maintenance of the vegetation will be carried out by local agencies, reinforcing EcoLane's impact on the local economy.</p>

      </div>

      <h3>Governance</h3>
      <p>We believe in full transparency. Everyone has the right to know what's happening in their city, that's why we share all our data, all our results, with the people directly affected by the EcoLane project. No hidden figures, no promises, just facts that we share with everyone.</p>

    <!-- Internal Structure & Team -->
    <section>
      <h2>Internal Structure &amp; Team</h2>
      <p>EcoLane will employ between 40 and 50 people directly on site, initially in Paris and then as the project develops: engineers, biotechnology experts, landscape architects, data analysts and coordination staff. These talents are complemented by partnerships with local nurseries, farms and urban maintenance companies.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Workspace & Organisation -->
    <section>
      <h2>Workspace &amp; Organisation</h2>
      <p>We will be moving into eco-responsible buildings close to our infrastructure to enable our teams to work more efficiently. Ourmanagement puts the well-being of our employees first, by promoting a healthy, collaborative working environment where everyone can flourish. We take care to maintain a balance between quality of working life and performance requirements, by adopting flexible practices and supporting the personal development of each team member. We aim to keep our employees effective and to retain our teams for as long as possible. Employees will be remunerated according to their position and performance, creating a system of meritocracy.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Project Development -->
    <section>
      <h2>Project Development</h2>
      <p>The EcoLane project is designed to be both environmentally and economically sustainable. The estimated costs for the various phases of the project are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>R&amp;D: between €2 and €3 million</li>
        <li>Deployment: around €5 million</li>
        <li>Annual maintenance: less than €500 000</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The return on investment is expected to be between 6 and 8 years, thanks to the use of carbon credits and public subsidies, as well as the possibility of replicating the model in other cities around the world.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Expansion -->
    <section>
      <h2>Expansion</h2>
      <p>Depending on the results achieved on the Paris ring road, our project has huge potential for development. We could install our technologies in any large city with a climate that allows miscanthus and dwarf paulownia to grow.</p>
