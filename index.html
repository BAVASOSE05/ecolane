      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Global warming is an extremely urgent problem, and EcoLane wants to have an immediate, day-to-day impact on it. At EcoLane, we're convinced that even our roads can play a much greater role in fighting against greenhouse gas emissions than just being conduits for cars. Paris is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, but its ring road is extremely polluted. EcoLane can transform this unwelcoming place into a green corridor.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>We dream of roads that can do much more than transport vehicles. For us, they can help purify the air by capturing CO₂ as soon as it is emitted. How is this possible? By merging technology and nature. EcoLane takes care of planting plants that have been carefully selected by our research teams for their impact on the environment. We link these plants with technological advances such as the moss paving stones installed on the emergency stop bollards, which with the help of technology have a very high absorption capacity. Finally, our bioreactors enable us to transform the absorbed CO₂ into green energy. Our ambition is to give the people of Paris back their ability to breathe, by cleaning the air in every kilometre of the ring road.</p>

      <h2>Our Values</h2>
      <h3>Environmental Responsibility</h3>
      <p>We work in harmony with nature. Our technologies allow nature to reclaim its rights in the Paris region, which is overrun by apartment blocks. EcoLane considerably improves air quality and living conditions for local residents. Our project requires little in the way of maintenance or natural resources. EcoLane effectively combats global warming.</p>

      <h3>Social Inclusion</h3>
      <p>The EcoLane project has an impact on more than just the environment. We are convinced that a green city is a living city, built with and for its inhabitants. We are strengthening the local economy and filling job vacancies. We grow our plants in local nurseries and farms.</p>

      <h3>Transparency & Innovation</h3>
      <p>We don’t just talk about impact, we prove it. We install sensors along the ring road to monitor CO₂ levels and air quality in real time. These data are made publicly available, without filters, so that anyone can follow our progress day by day.</p>

      <h2>Let’s Rethink What Roads Can Do</h2>
      <p>EcoLane is more than a project — it’s a vision for the future of cities. We don’t wait for cleaner air — we grow it. We don’t wait for the climate to change — we change the infrastructure.</p>
      <p><strong>Ready to build the future with us?</strong><br/>EcoLane — Greening mobility, one kilometer at a time.</p>
