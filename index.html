      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        EcoLane is a sustainable urban innovation project that combines nature and technology to reduce CO₂ emissions along major city roads. Our pilot project focuses on transforming the Paris ring road into a living carbon sink using green infrastructure.

      <h2>Our ESG Commitments</h2>
      <h3>1. Environmental – On-site CO₂ Capture</h3>
      <p>
        We use Miscanthus, Paulownia trees, and experimental bio-reactors to absorb CO₂ emissions along traffic-heavy corridors. These installations are designed to capture up to 12,000 tons of CO₂ per year while improving air quality and reducing urban heat islands.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Social – Green Jobs & Urban Regeneration</h3>
      <p>
        EcoLane creates inclusive employment opportunities in urban agriculture, environmental maintenance, and sustainable logistics. We also support a circular economy by transforming biomass into compost, biofuel, or timber.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Governance – Measurable, Transparent Impact</h3>
      <p>
        We deploy environmental sensors and publish real-time data on air quality and carbon capture. Our reports are independently reviewed, and we collaborate with research institutions to validate our results and ensure long-term accountability.
