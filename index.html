    <h1>EcoLane: Rethinking the Road to Breathe Easier</h1>
  </header>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        EcoLane started with a simple idea: we realised that road traffic is responsible for a major proportion of CO₂ emissions in Europe.
        In the Paris region, it accounts for more than half. Although the use of electric vehicles is gaining ground,
        they are not enough to respond to the climate emergency. So we need to act now.
        That's why we came up with the idea of EcoLane.
      </p>
      <p>
        We started with the idea that roads could do more than just transport cars.
        At EcoLane, we believe that they can also make an active contribution to purifying the air.
        Our project transforms the Paris ring road into an ecological corridor.
        By combining nature and technology, we want to give the city of Paris a quality of life that matches its beauty.

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Plantations of miscanthus and dwarf paulownia, selected for their rapid growth, low maintenance and exceptional ability to capture CO₂.</li>
        <li>Absorbent foam blocks, integrated into lane separators and verges, capable of retaining up to 1,000 tonnes of CO₂ per year per 250 units.</li>
        <li>Bioreactors installed on central medians, transforming captured CO₂ into green energy or recoverable biomass.</li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Project Progress</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>R&D phase (3 years): plant selection, material design and environmental simulations.</li>
        <li>Two years of real-world tests to validate safety, effectiveness, and integration.</li>
        <li>One year of installation to cover 35 km of the ring road with around 15 hectares of vegetation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our ESG Commitments</h2>

      <h3>Environment</h3>
      <p>
        The project's main aim is to absorb CO₂ on the ring road.
        With miscanthus, foam blocks and bioreactors, we aim to reduce Paris’s CO₂ emissions by 12,000 tonnes per year—around 10% of total emissions.
        Bioreactors convert gases into green energy. EcoLane improves air quality and quality of life for residents.
      </p>

      <h3>Social</h3>
      <p>
        We create jobs in the regions where we operate, and support local farmers and gardeners.
        Tree production and moss block maintenance are carried out by local partners.
      </p>

      <h3>Governance</h3>
      <p>
        We believe in full transparency. All our environmental data is open and shared with the public — no hidden figures, just facts.

      <h2>Internal Values and Practices</h2>

      <h3>Internal Structure and Team</h3>
      <p>
        EcoLane will employ 40 to 50 people on-site in Paris: engineers, biotechnology experts, landscape architects, data analysts and coordinators.
        We collaborate with local nurseries, farms and maintenance companies.
      </p>

      <h3>Workplace and Organisation</h3>
      <p>
        Our team will work from eco-friendly offices near our infrastructure.
        We prioritise employee well-being, flexibility and meritocracy.
      </p>

      <h2>Project Development</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>R&D: €2–3 million</li>
        <li>Deployment: ~€5 million</li>
        <li>Annual maintenance: less than €500,000</li>
        <li>ROI: 6–8 years via carbon credits and replication in other cities</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Expansion</h2>
      <p>
        Based on results from Paris, we aim to expand EcoLane to any large city with a climate suitable for miscanthus and dwarf paulownia.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        EcoLane is a project designed to grow and adapt.
        In the future, we aim to include solar panels and acoustic solutions to further improve city life.
        <strong>EcoLane — For greener cities, more useful roads, and cleaner air.</strong>
