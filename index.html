      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        EcoLane is an urban sustainability project that integrates vegetation, bioreactors, and eco-engineered materials to actively capture carbon emissions where they’re most concentrated: alongside busy roads.
        Our pilot initiative targets the Paris ring road, aiming to transform it into a living carbon sink, reducing pollution and improving urban quality of life.

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        To make urban mobility more sustainable by capturing CO₂ directly at the source through a hybrid system of natural absorption, bio-innovation, and circular design.
        We envision cities where roads clean the air rather than pollute it.

      <h2>Our Company Values</h2>
      <h3>Environmental Responsibility</h3>
      <p>
        We use nature-based technologies like Miscanthus and Paulownia, paired with eco-designed foam blocks, to regenerate polluted urban spaces.
        Every component is designed to support biodiversity, purify the air, and enhance climate resilience.
      </p>
      <h3>Social Inclusion</h3>
      <p>
        EcoLane is committed to creating local green jobs in agriculture, construction, and environmental tech.
        We collaborate with urban communities and local authorities to ensure our solutions serve the people and places that need them most.
      </p>
      <h3>Transparency & Innovation</h3>
      <p>
        All our operations are guided by data, ethics, and accountability.
        We publish real-time CO₂ absorption data via sensors, work with research institutions to validate our performance, and constantly improve the system’s scalability.

      <h2>Our ESG Commitments</h2>
      <h3>1. Environmental – On-site CO₂ Capture with Nature & Technology</h3>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong><br/>
      In Paris, more than 50% of CO₂ emissions come from road transport. Cities must act now to reduce their carbon footprint at the source.</p>
      <p><strong>Our solution:</strong><br/>
      - 15 hectares of Miscanthus and Paulownia nain planted<br/>
      - CO₂-absorbing foam blocks (1,000 tons/year per 250 blocks)<br/>
      - Bioreactors convert CO₂ into green energy<br/>
      - Real-time sensors to measure and optimize</p>
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong><br/>
      Up to 12,000 tons of CO₂ captured annually with improved air quality and reduced urban heat</p>

      <h3>2. Social – Green Jobs & Urban Regeneration</h3>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong><br/>
      Urban sustainability is also about people. We aim to restore nature in cities while creating meaningful, local employment.</p>
      <p><strong>Our actions:</strong><br/>
      - Jobs in farming, maintenance, logistics, and recycling<br/>
      - Partnerships with nurseries and local suppliers<br/>
      - Biomass reused as compost, mulch, or biofuel<br/>
      - Improved urban space quality in priority areas</p>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong><br/>
      A replicable model of inclusive, community-driven green transition</p>

      <h3>3. Governance – Transparent, Measurable, Circular</h3>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong><br/>
      Innovation must be measurable and ethical. Impact should be proven, not promised.</p>
      <p><strong>How we ensure it:</strong><br/>
      - CO₂ and air quality sensors across project areas<br/>
      - Third-party verified ESG reports, published annually<br/>
      - End-of-life reuse for all materials<br/>
      - Full compliance with urban and ecological standards</p>
      <p><strong>Vision:</strong><br/>
      A transparent and circular urban system that cities can replicate and improve</p>

      <h2>Let’s Rethink the Roads</h2>
      <p>
        EcoLane is more than a project — it’s a vision for the future of cities.<br/>
        We don’t wait for cleaner air — we grow it.<br/>
        We don’t wait for the climate to change — we change the infrastructure.
      </p>
