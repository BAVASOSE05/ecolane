    <!-- Our Vision -->
    <section>
      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>EcoLane started with a simple idea: we realised that road traffic is responsible for a major proportion of CO₂ emissions in Europe. In the Paris region, it accounts for more than half. Although the use of electric vehicles is gaining ground, they are not enough to respond to the climate emergency. So we need to act now. That's why we came up with the idea of EcoLane.</p>
      <p>We started with the idea that roads could do more than just transport cars.</p>
      <p>At EcoLane, we believe that they can also make an active contribution to purifying the air. Our project transforms the Paris ring road into an ecological corridor. By combining nature and technology, we want to give the city of Paris a quality of life that matches its beauty.</p>

    <!-- Our Mission -->
    <section>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Our project is based on three complementary points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plantations of miscanthus and dwarf paulownia, they have been selected for their rapid growth, low maintenance and exceptional ability to capture CO₂.</li>
        <li>Absorbent foam blocks, integrated into lane separators and verges, which can retain up to 1 000 t CO₂/an pour 250 unités.</li>
        <li>Bioreactors installés sur la bande centrale, capables de transformer le CO₂ capturé en énergie verte ou biomasse récupérable.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Our ESG Commitments -->
    <section>
      <h2>Our ESG Commitments</h2>

      <h3>Environment</h3>
      <p>The main aim of the project is to absorb CO₂ on the ring road, as statistics show that urban transport is one of the main sources of global warming. By installing miscanthus and bioreactors on the median strip of the ring road, as well as foam blocks on the hard shoulder and dwarf paulownia on the verges, we intend to drastically reduce Paris's CO₂ emissions. We can absorb 12 000 t CO₂/an (≈10 % des émissions). Nos bioréacteurs convertissent ensuite une partie en énergie verte.</p>

      <h3>Social</h3>
      <p>We want to create jobs locally and support small farmers and nurseries by sourcing our plants nearby. Recycling of foam blocks and vegetation maintenance is confié à des agences régionales, renforçant l’impact économique local.</p>

      <h3>Governance</h3>
      <p>Full transparency: all data and results are shared with residents—no hidden figures, just facts.</p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>A project designed to grow thanks to its adaptability to a wide range of environments. Eventually, we plan to add photovoltaic panels and acoustic materials to further improve living conditions.</p>
