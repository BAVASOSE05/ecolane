    <!-- Our Vision -->
    <section>
      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>EcoLane started with a simple idea: we realised that road traffic is responsible for a major proportion of CO₂ emissions in Europe. In the Paris region, it accounts for more than half. Although the use of electric vehicles is gaining ground, they are not enough to respond to the climate emergency. So we need to act now. That's why we came up with the idea of EcoLane.</p>
      <p>We started with the idea that roads could do more than just transport cars.</p>
      <p>At EcoLane, we believe that they can also make an active contribution to purifying the air. Our project transforms the Paris ring road into an ecological corridor. By combining nature and technology, we want to give the city of Paris a quality of life that matches its beauty.</p>

    <!-- Our Mission -->
    <section>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Our project is based on three complementary points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plantations of miscanthus and dwarf paulownia, they have been selected for their rapid growth, low maintenance and exceptional ability to capture CO₂.</li>
        <li>Absorbent foam blocks, integrated into lane separators and verges, which can retain up to 1 000 tonnes of CO₂ per year for 250 units installed.</li>
        <li>Bioreactors installed on the central medians, capable of transforming the CO₂ captured into green energy or recoverable biomass.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Project Progress -->
    <section>
      <h2>Project Progress</h2>
      <p>We have structured the project into three main stages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A research and development phase (3 years), aimed at plant selection, material design and initial environmental simulations.</li>
        <li>Two years of tests in real conditions to validate safety, effectiveness and urban integration.</li>
        <li>One year of installation to cover 35 km of the Paris ring road (~15 ha of vegetated surfaces).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Our ESG Commitments -->
    <section>
      <h2>Our ESG Commitments</h2>

      <h3>Environment</h3>
      <p>The main aim of the project is to absorb CO₂ on the ring road, as statistics show that urban transport is one of the main sources of global warming. By installing miscanthus and bioreactors on the median strip of the ring road, as well as foam blocks on the hard shoulder and dwarf paulownia on the verges, we intend to drastically reduce Paris’s CO₂ emissions. We can absorb 12 000 t CO₂/an (~10 % des émissions). Our bioreactors convert part of it into green energy.</p>

      <h3>Social</h3>
      <p>We want to create jobs in the regions where we operate, as well as support small farmers and gardeners by sourcing our trees from local nurseries and farms. Recycling of foam blocks and vegetation maintenance will be carried out by regional agencies, reinforcing EcoLane’s impact on the local economy.</p>

      <h3>Governance</h3>
      <p>We believe in full transparency. Everyone has the right to know what’s happening in their city, which is why we share all our data and results with the people directly affected by EcoLane. No hidden figures, no empty promises—just facts.</p>

    </section>

    <!-- Internal Structure & Team -->
    <section>
      <h2>Internal Structure &amp; Team</h2>
      <p>EcoLane will employ between 40 and 50 people directly on site, initially in Paris and then as the project develops: engineers, biotechnology experts, landscape architects, data analysts and coordination staff. These talents are complemented by partnerships with local nurseries, farms and urban maintenance companies.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Workspace & Organisation -->
    <section>
      <h2>Workspace &amp; Organisation</h2>
      <p>We will be moving into eco-responsible buildings close to our infrastructure to enable our teams to work more efficiently. Our management places employee well-being first by promoting a healthy, collaborative environment where everyone can flourish. We balance quality of working life with performance requirements through flexible practices and personal development support, aiming to retain talented staff and reward merit.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Project Development -->
    <section>
      <h2>Project Development</h2>
      <p>The EcoLane project is designed to be both environmentally and economically sustainable. Estimated costs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>R&amp;D: €2–3 million</li>
        <li>Deployment: ~€5 million</li>
        <li>Annual maintenance: < €500 000</li>
      </ul>
      <p>ROI is expected in 6–8 years, thanks to carbon credits, public subsidies and the possibility of exporting the model to other cities worldwide.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Expansion -->
    <section>
      <h2>Expansion</h2>
      <p>Depending on results on the Paris ring road, EcoLane can be deployed in any large city whose climate supports miscanthus and dwarf paulownia growth.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- PESTLE Analysis -->
    <section>
      <h2>PESTLE Analysis &ndash; Impact &amp; Development</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Policy:</strong> Support from local authorities and favourable energy-transition policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic:</strong> Job creation, rapid ROI and export potential.</li>
        <li><strong>Social:</strong> Improved local quality of life and economic inclusion.</li>
        <li><strong>Technological:</strong> Cutting-edge bioreactors and absorbent blocks—modular and scalable.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental:</strong> Direct reduction of CO₂ and better air quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Legislative:</strong> Full compliance with environmental standards and local regulations.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>A project designed to grow thanks to its adaptability to various environments. Eventually, we plan to incorporate photovoltaic panels and acoustic materials to further improve living conditions.</p>
